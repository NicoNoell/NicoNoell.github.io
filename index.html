            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Nico and I am a student at the Technical University of Munich (<a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TUM</a>) in the departments of Math and Computer Science.
                I am passionate about many things, some of which are programming, writing, sports and learning things about the World. <br>
                To learn more about the things I do, just keep scrolling.

            <h1>Programming-Projects</h1>
            <p>I've been in love with programming since I first got into touch with it in 5th grade. Since then I've aquired a wide range of skills and 
                also made a few litte Projects. My main programming languages are python, C# and C++, but I am pretty flexible when it comes to programming languages.

            <p style="color: #202020; font-weight: 600;">
                As already mentioned, I also like to write and think about different stuff, of which most is probably more philosophical.
