            <h1>My Programming-Languages</h1>
            <p>Here are the programming-languages I've learned over time together with my level of experience with them:</p>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Python (experienced)</b></summary>
                    <p class="ProgrammingDetails">Python was my first real programming language (after Scratch). It was the basis for my understanding of object-oriented programming and 
                    has remained my favorite programming language since I first got into touch with it. Below or under <a href="./../projects/projects.html">Projects</a> you will find many little programms and games made with Python. <br>
                    I have around <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2018)</script> years of experience with Python (though I don't think that's a reliable measurement for coding-skill).
                    </p>
                </details>
                <br>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>C# (intermediate)</b></summary>
                    <p class="ProgrammingDetails">Like almost every young developer I was mostly interested in making games and thus got into touch with C# and Unity. It was a considerable step up from the simple (more or less) typeless python
                        I was used to and it took some time for me to be able to produce something without a tutorial. After a year or so I, for the time, quit Unity and worked more closely with Windows Forms in .NET (dot-Net). <br>
                        Then, around 2 years later I again came into contact with C# at an internship. I learned concepts like Unit-testing (which I still often find superfluous) and navigating large code bases. <br>
                        Overall, I have around <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2020)</script> years of experience with C#.
                    </p>
                </details>
                <br>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>C++ (learning)</b></summary>
                    <p class="ProgrammingDetails">I have always been a bit scared of C++. It's a very powerful language that has evolved so much over the years, that at least I think, it cannot be fully understood by just one person.
                        Currently I'm trying to learn the basics of it anyways, while building my own Ray-Tracer following <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">this nice Article</a> that offers a great introduction to newcommers like me. 
                    </p>
                </details>
                <br>
                <details>
                    <summary><b>Html, Css and Javascript (I did those to myself to build this Website)</b></summary>
                    <p class="ProgrammingDetails">As the summary-heading might give away, I'm not really a big fan of any of the three. I don't <i>hate</i> them, but they are often just not nice to work with (you dont want to know how often i needed to look up how to correctly center elements or text while building this website).
                        If necessary however, I am able to create whatever is needed with them, but I'm already sure that I don't want to be a Web-Developer. 
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary><b>Java (just basic stuff)</b></summary>
                    <p class="ProgrammingDetails">The only time I've used Java so far was in High-School, where we made different data-structures and talked about concepts like recursion and inheritance. It was all very boring, expecially if you already know everything.
                        Anyways, I don't really have an opinion on Java. All I know is its slogan: "Write once, <s>debug</s> run everywhere".
